Crypto Portfolio Tracker Settings Configuration File

bsc_portfolio: a binance smart chain coin dictionary {contract:quantity} where "contract" is the token's contract address string and "quantity" is an int for the quantity you own
eth_portfolio: a ethereum blockchain coin dictionary {contract:quantity} where "contract" is the token's contract address string and "quantity" is an int for the quantity you own
headless: a bool parameter that sets whether the selenium background coin tracking firefox processes will be visible to user or not (suggested: True)
firefox_profile_path: a raw string parameter for the filepath of your firefox profile (set to None if you don't want to use profile, suggested to visit dextools and bogged manually in firefox browser before using)
use_random_user_agent: a bool parameter that sets whether a random user agent will be used for each coin tracking browser
use_proxies: a bool parameter that sets whether or not a unique proxy will be used for each coin tracking browser to get around DDOS protection. Buggy (suggested: False)
ddos_bypass: a bool parameter that bypasses coin tracking website ddos protectors with the trade off of longer initial load time upon launch (suggested: True)
ddos_sleep: an int parameter that sets the sleep time in between opening browsers to circumvent ddos protection (Suggested: 7+)
refresh_time: an int number that sets the refresh time for updating prices. Higher time uses less CPU (suggested: 1-5 seconds)
